# This exercise is Part 3 of 4 of the birthday data exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 1, 
# Part 2, and Part 4. 
# In the previous exercise we saved information about famous scientistsâ€™ names and birthdays to disk. 
# In this exercise, load that JSON file from disk, extract the months of all the birthdays, and count 
# how many scientists have a birthday in each month. 

# Your program should output something like: 
# { 
#        "May": 3, 
#        "November": 2, 
#        "December": 1 
# } 
import json 
from collections import Counter

# Load data from json file..
